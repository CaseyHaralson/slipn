# Slipn
Slipn is a slide show library for interactive presentations.
The library can do several things:
* resize slides to the current window size (or centers slides on bigger monitors)
* allows deep linking to slides
* slide preloading (only load slides as they are needed)
* old slide removal (keeps the current page size down - helpful if viewing large image slides on an iPad, for example)
* uses your “previous” and “next” links for slide control

## Getting Started
There are a couple of ways to download Slipn:
* Download the zip
* Bower – (code) bower install slipnslide
* Clone the repo: (code) git clone url

Once you have a copy of Slipn, reference the css file and javascript file in your project.
Tell Slipn where the slides are on the page along with any other options, and then start the slide show.
